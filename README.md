Traffic Accident Data Analysis and Visualization Project
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing traffic accident data to identify patterns and trends related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. By visualizing accident hotspots and identifying contributing factors, the project aims to provide valuable insights into how various elements influence traffic accidents. The analysis and visualization are performed using Python, and the project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

Features
Data Collection:
Importing and cleaning traffic accident datasets (e.g., accident records from open data sources).
Data Analysis:
Identifying patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day.
Analyzing accident frequency and severity based on different factors.
Visualization:
Mapping accident hotspots using geographical data.
Visualizing accident data by time of day, weather conditions, and road types.
Using bar charts, heatmaps, and geographical plots to display the analysis results.
Technologies Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
geopandas for handling geographical data and plotting maps.
folium for interactive map visualization.
numpy for numerical operations.
